  - question: |
      Consider the following method intended to return the sum of the even elements in an array of integers.

      ```java
      public static int sumEvens(int[] nums)
      {
          int sum = 0;
          for (int k = 0; k < nums.length; k++)
          {
              if (/* condition */)
                  sum += nums[k];
          }
          return sum;
      }
      ```

      Which of the following replacements for `/* condition */` would correctly accumulate only the even numbers in the array?

      I.   `nums[k] % 2 == 0`  
      II.  `nums[k] / 2 == 0`  
      III. `nums[k] % 2 != 1`

    correct_options:
      - I and III only
    wrong_options:
      - I only
      - II only
      - III only
      - I and II only
      - II and III only
    explanation: |
      I: Correct. This is the standard check for even numbers.
      II: Incorrect. This returns true only when nums[k] is 0 or 1 (due to integer division).
      III: Correct. This is logically equivalent to checking for even values since odd numbers leave remainder 1 when divided by 2.
      I only: Incorrect. It omits another correct option (III).
      II only: Incorrect. II does not correctly detect even numbers.
      III only: Incorrect. It omits I, which is also correct.
      I and II only: Incorrect. II is wrong.
      II and III only: Incorrect. II is wrong.

  - question: |
      Suppose you want to create a method that determines whether an array contains any duplicate values.

      Which of the following would be valid approaches to determine if an array contains duplicates?

      I.   Nested loops comparing every pair of elements  
      II.  Use a Set to check if a duplicate is added  
      III. Sorting the array and checking for consecutive duplicates

    correct_options:
      - I, II, and III
    wrong_options:
      - I only
      - II only
      - III only
      - I and II only
      - II and III only
    explanation: |
      I: Correct. Brute-force approach using nested loops works correctly but is inefficient.
      II: Correct. Sets reject duplicates, so trying to add a duplicate will detect it.
      III: Correct. Sorting brings duplicates together, making them easy to detect.
      I only: Incorrect. Other correct approaches (II and III) are omitted.
      II only: Incorrect. Omits I and III, which are also correct.
      III only: Incorrect. Omits I and II.
      I and II only: Incorrect. Omits III.
      II and III only: Incorrect. Omits I.

  - question: |
      What will the following method return when passed the array `{4, 3, 2, 1}`?

      ```java
      public static int mystery(int[] arr)
      {
          int result = arr[0];
          for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++)
          {
              result -= arr[i];
          }
          return result;
      }
      ```

      What is the returned value and what does the method appear to do?

      I.   Returns `-2` and subtracts all elements from the first  
      II.  Returns `2` and finds the difference between max and min  
      III. Returns `-2` and is equivalent to `arr[0] - (arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3])`

    correct_options:
      - I and III only
    wrong_options:
      - I only
      - II only
      - III only
      - I and II only
      - II and III only
    explanation: |
      I: Correct. It returns -2: 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 = -2.
      II: Incorrect. The method doesn't find the difference between max and min.
      III: Correct. That's exactly what the method does: subtracts the sum of the rest from the first.
      I only: Incorrect. Omits III.
      II only: Incorrect. Misrepresents what the method does.
      III only: Incorrect. Omits I.
      I and II only: Incorrect. II is wrong.
      II and III only: Incorrect. II is wrong.

  - question: |
      Which of the following statements about arrays in Java are true?

      I.   Arrays can hold primitive types and object references  
      II.  The size of an array can be changed after its creation  
      III. Array indices start at 1 in Java

    correct_options:
      - I only
    wrong_options:
      - II only
      - III only
      - I and II only
      - II and III only
      - I and III only
    explanation: |
      I: Correct. Arrays can store primitives (like `int`) or references (like `String`).
      II: Incorrect. Java arrays are fixed in size after creation.
      III: Incorrect. Java uses 0-based indexing.
      II only: Incorrect. II is false.
      III only: Incorrect. III is false.
      I and II only: Incorrect. II is false.
      II and III only: Incorrect. Both are false.
      I and III only: Incorrect. III is false.

  - question: |
      Consider the following code snippet:

      ```java
      int[] nums = {10, 20, 30, 40};
      int total = 0;
      for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
      {
          total += nums[i];
      }
      ```

      Which of the following statements are true?

      I.   This loop sums the elements of the array in reverse order  
      II.  The final value of `total` will be 100  
      III. The loop throws an exception due to index out-of-bounds

    correct_options:
      - I and II only
    wrong_options:
      - I only
      - II only
      - III only
      - I and III only
      - II and III only
    explanation: |
      I: Correct. The loop starts at the last index and works backwards.
      II: Correct. 40 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 100.
      III: Incorrect. The loop bounds are valid, no out-of-bounds error occurs.
      I only: Incorrect. Omits II.
      II only: Incorrect. Omits I.
      III only: Incorrect. No exception is thrown.
      I and III only: Incorrect. III is incorrect.
      II and III only: Incorrect. III is incorrect.
  - question: |
      A programmer is writing a method that searches an array for the first element that matches a given condition.  
      The problem specification does not specify what should happen if no such element exists.  
      What is the best way to handle this situation?

    correct_options:
      - The specification should be revised to define behavior when no match is found.
    wrong_options:
      - Assume that the array will always contain a matching element.
      - Return -1 without updating the specification.
      - Throw an exception without mentioning it in the specification.
    explanation: |
      The specification should be revised to define behavior when no match is found: Correct. It’s best practice to clarify expected behavior in the specification so the method's behavior is predictable and documented.
      Assume that the array will always contain a matching element: Incorrect. This introduces risk of bugs or unexpected behavior if assumptions are violated.
      Return -1 without updating the specification: Incorrect. While returning -1 may be a good choice, it must be clearly stated in the specification.
      Throw an exception without mentioning it in the specification: Incorrect. Exceptions should be documented in the specification to ensure the behavior is expected.

  - question: |
      A student writes a method that calculates the average of an array of integers.  
      The problem specification does not indicate whether the array might be empty.  
      What is the best course of action?

    correct_options:
      - Modify the specification to state what should happen if the array is empty.
    wrong_options:
      - Assume the array will always contain at least one value.
      - Return 0 if the array is empty without changing the specification.
      - Ignore the possibility of an empty array, since it will likely never occur.
    explanation: |
      Modify the specification to state what should happen if the array is empty: Correct. This ensures that the method handles edge cases predictably and responsibly.
      Assume the array will always contain at least one value: Incorrect. This assumption can lead to division-by-zero errors if violated.
      Return 0 if the array is empty without changing the specification: Incorrect. Silent assumptions create ambiguity and can mislead others using the method.
      Ignore the possibility of an empty array, since it will likely never occur: Incorrect. Defensive programming requires handling all realistic scenarios, including empty arrays.

  - question: |
      A method is being developed to return the index of the last occurrence of a specific value in an array.  
      The specification does not state what should happen if the value does not appear in the array.  
      Which of the following is the best approach?

    correct_options:
      - Clarify the specification to state what should be returned when the value is not found.
    wrong_options:
      - Return the first index by default.
      - Return index 0 to indicate "not found."
      - Leave the return value unspecified and document that behavior may vary.
    explanation: |
      Clarify the specification to state what should be returned when the value is not found: Correct. It is essential to specify expected output clearly for all cases, especially edge ones.
      Return the first index by default: Incorrect. This does not meet the goal of finding the last occurrence and is misleading.
      Return index 0 to indicate "not found.": Incorrect. Index 0 may be a valid index of the target value, so this would create confusion.
      Leave the return value unspecified and document that behavior may vary: Incorrect. Good specifications should never permit undefined behavior.

  - question: |
      A method is designed to count the number of elements greater than a threshold in an array.  
      The specification does not say whether the threshold itself should be counted.  
      What should the programmer do?

    correct_options:
      - Update the specification to state whether values equal to the threshold should be included.
    wrong_options:
      - Include equal values without noting it in the specification.
      - Exclude equal values without explanation.
      - Leave the behavior up to whoever calls the method.
    explanation: |
      Update the specification to state whether values equal to the threshold should be included: Correct. This removes ambiguity and makes the method behavior clear to future users.
      Include equal values without noting it in the specification: Incorrect. This leads to uncertainty about method behavior.
      Exclude equal values without explanation: Incorrect. Behavior should be clearly stated in the specification.
      Leave the behavior up to whoever calls the method: Incorrect. The method’s behavior should be consistent and predictable, which requires an explicit specification.

  - question: |
      A method will be written to return the first prime number in an array.  
      The specification does not mention whether negative numbers are allowed or whether 1 is considered prime.  
      Which is the best approach?

    correct_options:
      - Revise the specification to clearly define what counts as a valid prime and valid input.
    wrong_options:
      - Assume all input is positive and define primes accordingly.
      - Treat 1 as a prime number for simplicity.
      - Return any value that passes a basic modulo test without further clarification.
    explanation: |
      Revise the specification to clearly define what counts as a valid prime and valid input: Correct. Clear definitions ensure that behavior is mathematically correct and unambiguous.
      Assume all input is positive and define primes accordingly: Incorrect. Unstated assumptions can lead to incorrect results or confusion.
      Treat 1 as a prime number for simplicity: Incorrect. By mathematical definition, 1 is not prime.
      Return any value that passes a basic modulo test without further clarification: Incorrect. This can result in logically incorrect results if prime criteria are not clearly defined.
  - question: |
      Examine the `insertMiddle` method:

      ```java
      public static void insertMiddle(ArrayList<Integer> list, int value)
      {
          int mid = list.size() / 2;
          list.add(mid, value);
      }
      ```

      What is the postcondition after calling `insertMiddle`?
    correct_options:
      - The `value` is inserted at the middle index, and all subsequent elements are shifted one position right.
    wrong_options:
      - The `value` replaces the element at the middle index.
      - The `value` is added at the end of the list.
      - Two copies of `value` are inserted into the list.
    explanation: |
      The `value` is inserted at the middle index, and all subsequent elements are shifted one position right: Correct. `add(index, value)` inserts, not replaces.
      The `value` replaces the element at the middle index: Incorrect. `add` shifts elements; it does not replace.
      The `value` is added at the end of the list: Incorrect. Insertion is at the middle, not the end.
      Two copies of `value` are inserted into the list: Incorrect. Only one insertion occurs.

  - question: |
      Analyze the following `removeAndReturn` method:

      ```java
      public static String removeAndReturn(ArrayList<String> list, int index)
      {
          return list.remove(index);
      }
      ```

      Which best describes the postcondition for `removeAndReturn`?

    correct_options:
      - The element at `index` is removed from the list and returned.
    wrong_options:
      - The element at `index` is replaced with `null`.
      - The list becomes empty.
      - The entire list is shifted left by two positions.
    explanation: |
      The element at `index` is removed from the list and returned: Correct. `remove` deletes the element and shifts later elements left by one.
      The element at `index` is replaced with `null`: Incorrect. `remove` eliminates the element, not replacing it with `null`.
      The list becomes empty: Incorrect. Only one element is removed.
      The entire list is shifted left by two positions: Incorrect. Only a single shift by one occurs after one removal.

  - question: |
      Refer to the `replaceFirstLast` method:

      ```java
      public static void replaceFirstLast(ArrayList<Integer> list)
      {
          if (list.size() >= 2)
          {
              int temp = list.get(0);
              list.set(0, list.get(list.size() - 1));
              list.set(list.size() - 1, temp);
          }
      }
      ```

      Which best describes the postcondition of `replaceFirstLast`?

    correct_options:
      - The first and last elements are swapped if the list has at least two elements.
    wrong_options:
      - The list is cleared.
      - A new element is appended to the list.
      - The first element is replaced with 0.
    explanation: |
      The first and last elements are swapped if the list has at least two elements: Correct. The swap only happens if there are at least two elements.
      The list is cleared: Incorrect. No clearing happens.
      A new element is appended to the list: Incorrect. No new elements are added.
      The first element is replaced with 0: Incorrect. The first element is replaced with the original last element, not 0.

  - question: |
      Examine the `duplicateFront` method:

      ```java
      public static void duplicateFront(ArrayList<String> list)
      {
          if (list.size() > 0)
          {
              list.add(0, list.get(0));
          }
      }
      ```

      Which best describes the postcondition after calling `duplicateFront`?

    correct_options:
      - The first element is duplicated and inserted at the front, shifting the original elements right.
    wrong_options:
      - The first element is removed and duplicated at the end.
      - All elements are shifted left by one position.
      - A null value is inserted at the front of the list.
    explanation: |
      The first element is duplicated and inserted at the front, shifting the original elements right: Correct. `add(0, list.get(0))` inserts a copy at index 0.
      The first element is removed and duplicated at the end: Incorrect. No removal occurs.
      All elements are shifted left by one position: Incorrect. The list shifts right due to the insertion.
      A null value is inserted at the front of the list: Incorrect. The inserted value is the existing first element, not `null`.

  - question: |
      Analyze the following `clearHalf` method:

      ```java
      public static void clearHalf(ArrayList<Double> list)
      {
          int mid = list.size() / 2;
          for (int i = list.size() - 1; i >= mid; i--)
          {
              list.remove(i);
          }
      }
      ```

      What is the postcondition after calling `clearHalf`?

    correct_options:
      - The list now contains only the first half of its original elements.
    wrong_options:
      - The entire list is emptied.
      - The second half of the list is duplicated.
      - The first half of the list is cleared, and the second half remains.
    explanation: |
      The list now contains only the first half of its original elements: Correct. Elements from the midpoint onward are removed.
      The entire list is emptied: Incorrect. Only half the list is removed.
      The second half of the list is duplicated: Incorrect. No duplication happens.
      The first half of the list is cleared, and the second half remains: Incorrect. The opposite happens — the second half is cleared.
  - question: |
      Refer to the `swapAdjacent` method below.

      ```java
      public static void swapAdjacent(ArrayList<Integer> list, int index)
      {
          int temp = list.get(index);
          list.set(index, list.get(index + 1));
          list.set(index + 1, temp);
      }
      ```

      What is the postcondition of `swapAdjacent` assuming `index` is valid?

    correct_options:
      - The elements at `index` and `index + 1` are swapped.
    wrong_options:
      - The element at `index` is removed.
      - The element at `index + 1` is set to null.
      - A new element is inserted between `index` and `index + 1`.
    explanation: |
      The elements at `index` and `index + 1` are swapped: Correct. The code saves one value and swaps their positions.
      The element at `index` is removed: Incorrect. No removal occurs; only values are exchanged.
      The element at `index + 1` is set to null: Incorrect. The list is only modified by swapping, not by inserting nulls.
      A new element is inserted between `index` and `index + 1`: Incorrect. No new elements are inserted.

  - question: |
      Analyze the `reverseEnds` method below:

      ```java
      public static void reverseEnds(ArrayList<String> list)
      {
          String temp = list.get(0);
          list.set(0, list.get(list.size() - 1));
          list.set(list.size() - 1, temp);
      }
      ```

      Which best describes the postcondition after executing `reverseEnds`?

    correct_options:
      - The first and last elements of `list` are swapped.
    wrong_options:
      - The list is reversed entirely.
      - A new element is added to the list.
      - Only the first element is changed.
    explanation: |
      The first and last elements of `list` are swapped: Correct. Only the two boundary elements are exchanged.
      The list is reversed entirely: Incorrect. Only two elements are swapped, not the whole list.
      A new element is added to the list: Incorrect. No elements are added; only existing ones are modified.
      Only the first element is changed: Incorrect. Both the first and last elements are affected.

  - question: |
      Examine the following `swapMiddle` method:

      ```java
      public static void swapMiddle(ArrayList<Double> list)
      {
          int mid1 = (list.size() - 1) / 2;
          int mid2 = list.size() / 2;
          double temp = list.get(mid1);
          list.set(mid1, list.get(mid2));
          list.set(mid2, temp);
      }
      ```

      Assuming the list has at least two elements, what is the postcondition?

    correct_options:
      - The two middle elements are swapped.
    wrong_options:
      - The middle elements are removed.
      - New elements are inserted into the list.
      - Only the first element is modified.
    explanation: |
      The two middle elements are swapped: Correct. `mid1` and `mid2` compute the middle indices and swap their elements.
      The middle elements are removed: Incorrect. No elements are removed; only swapping occurs.
      New elements are inserted into the list: Incorrect. No insertion, just reassignment.
      Only the first element is modified: Incorrect. The first element is unaffected unless it is in the middle.

  - question: |
      Consider the following `swapEndsIfNeeded` method:

      ```java
      public static void swapEndsIfNeeded(ArrayList<Character> list)
      {
          if (!list.get(0).equals(list.get(list.size() - 1)))
          {
              char temp = list.get(0);
              list.set(0, list.get(list.size() - 1));
              list.set(list.size() - 1, temp);
          }
      }
      ```

      Which best describes the postcondition for `swapEndsIfNeeded`?

    correct_options:
      - The first and last elements are swapped only if they are different.
    wrong_options:
      - The list always becomes empty.
      - The first and last elements are set to null.
      - A copy of the list is created.
    explanation: |
      The first and last elements are swapped only if they are different: Correct. Swapping happens only if the elements are not equal.
      The list always becomes empty: Incorrect. No elements are removed.
      The first and last elements are set to null: Incorrect. They are swapped, not nulled.
      A copy of the list is created: Incorrect. No new list is made.

  - question: |
      Review the following `swapFirstSecond` method:

      ```java
      public static void swapFirstSecond(ArrayList<String> words)
      {
          if (words.size() >= 2)
          {
              String temp = words.get(0);
              words.set(0, words.get(1));
              words.set(1, temp);
          }
      }
      ```

      What best describes the postcondition after executing `swapFirstSecond`?

    correct_options:
      - The first and second elements of `words` are swapped if the list has at least two elements.
    wrong_options:
      - The entire list is reversed.
      - A new word is added to the beginning of the list.
      - The first word is deleted.
    explanation: |
      The first and second elements of `words` are swapped if the list has at least two elements: Correct. Swap occurs only if size is sufficient.
      The entire list is reversed: Incorrect. Only two elements are exchanged, not the whole list.
      A new word is added to the beginning of the list: Incorrect. No new elements are added.
      The first word is deleted: Incorrect. No deletions are performed.

  - question: |
      Refer to the `safeSwap` method below.

      ```java
      public static void safeSwap(ArrayList<Integer> nums, int i, int j)
      {
          if (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && i < nums.size() && j < nums.size())
          {
              int temp = nums.get(i);
              nums.set(i, nums.get(j));
              nums.set(j, temp);
          }
      }
      ```

      What preconditions are necessary to avoid an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`?

    correct_options:
      - `i` and `j` must be valid indices between `0` and `nums.size() - 1` inclusive.
    wrong_options:
      - `i` and `j` must both be 0.
      - `i` must be less than `j`.
      - `nums` must contain only positive numbers.
    explanation: |
      `i` and `j` must be valid indices between `0` and `nums.size() - 1` inclusive: Correct. The method checks bounds to prevent errors.
      `i` and `j` must both be 0: Incorrect. They can be any valid indices.
      `i` must be less than `j`: Incorrect. No ordering between `i` and `j` is required.
      `nums` must contain only positive numbers: Incorrect. Values don't matter for swapping — only valid indices.

  - question: |
      Analyze the `swapFirstLast` method:

      ```java
      public static void swapFirstLast(ArrayList<Double> values)
      {
          double temp = values.get(0);
          values.set(0, values.get(values.size() - 1));
          values.set(values.size() - 1, temp);
      }
      ```

      What could cause an error when calling `swapFirstLast`?

    correct_options:
      - Calling the method with an empty list.
    wrong_options:
      - Calling the method with only positive numbers.
      - Calling the method when the list has an even number of elements.
      - Calling the method with duplicate elements.
    explanation: |
      Calling the method with an empty list: Correct. `get(0)` and `get(values.size() - 1)` would throw exceptions if the list is empty.
      Calling the method with only positive numbers: Incorrect. Values themselves don't cause errors.
      Calling the method when the list has an even number of elements: Incorrect. Size parity doesn't matter for swapping ends.
      Calling the method with duplicate elements: Incorrect. Duplicate values are irrelevant for index operations.

  - question: |
      Examine the `conditionalSwap` method:

      ```java
      public static void conditionalSwap(ArrayList<String> list, int i, int j)
      {
          if (list.get(i).compareTo(list.get(j)) > 0)
          {
              String temp = list.get(i);
              list.set(i, list.get(j));
              list.set(j, temp);
          }
      }
      ```

      What precondition is most important to ensure no runtime error?

    correct_options:
      - Both `i` and `j` must be valid indices within the bounds of `list`.
    wrong_options:
      - The elements at `i` and `j` must be equal.
      - The list must not contain null elements.
      - `i` must be greater than `j`.
    explanation: |
      Both `i` and `j` must be valid indices within the bounds of `list`: Correct. Index errors must be avoided when calling `get(i)` and `get(j)`.
      The elements at `i` and `j` must be equal: Incorrect. No need for equality — a swap happens based on compareTo.
      The list must not contain null elements: Incorrect. `compareTo` might throw a `NullPointerException`, but that's not the immediate focus for index validity.
      `i` must be greater than `j`: Incorrect. No specific relationship between `i` and `j` is required.

  - question: |
      Look at the `swapIfNeeded` method:

      ```java
      public static void swapIfNeeded(ArrayList<Character> letters, int a, int b)
      {
          if (letters.size() > 0 && a >= 0 && b >= 0 && a < letters.size() && b < letters.size())
          {
              char temp = letters.get(a);
              letters.set(a, letters.get(b));
              letters.set(b, temp);
          }
      }
      ```

      Which situation would prevent an exception?

    correct_options:
      - Providing indices `a` and `b` that are within the bounds of `letters`.
    wrong_options:
      - Ensuring that `letters` contains only uppercase letters.
      - Making sure `a` is smaller than `b`.
      - Making sure `b` is twice as large as `a`.
    explanation: |
      Providing indices `a` and `b` that are within the bounds of `letters`: Correct. Valid indices prevent exceptions like `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
      Ensuring that `letters` contains only uppercase letters: Incorrect. Letter case has no impact on list operations.
      Making sure `a` is smaller than `b`: Incorrect. Ordering doesn't prevent errors.
      Making sure `b` is twice as large as `a`: Incorrect. Same — valid bounds are the real issue.

  - question: |
      Analyze the `swapNonAdjacent` method:

      ```java
      public static void swapNonAdjacent(ArrayList<String> list, int x, int y)
      {
          if (Math.abs(x - y) > 1)
          {
              String temp = list.get(x);
              list.set(x, list.get(y));
              list.set(y, temp);
          }
      }
      ```

      What precondition must be true before calling `swapNonAdjacent`?

    correct_options:
      - x and y must be valid list indices.
    wrong_options:
      - x must be exactly 1 greater than y.
      - list must contain only numeric strings.
      - list must have an odd number of elements.
    explanation: |
      x and y must be valid list indices: Correct. Valid indices are necessary to safely access list.get(x) and list.get(y).
      x must be exactly 1 greater than y: Incorrect. The method only requires that x and y are not adjacent (difference > 1).
      list must contain only numeric strings: Incorrect. The content of the strings is irrelevant to swapping.
      list must have an odd number of elements: Incorrect. List size parity doesn't affect swapping ability.
  - question: |
      Refer to the `safeSwap` method below.

      ```java
      public static void safeSwap(ArrayList<Integer> nums, int i, int j)
      {
          if (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && i < nums.size() && j < nums.size())
          {
              int temp = nums.get(i);
              nums.set(i, nums.get(j));
              nums.set(j, temp);
          }
      }
      ```

      What preconditions are necessary to avoid an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`?

    correct_options:
      - `i` and `j` must be valid indices between `0` and `nums.size() - 1` inclusive.
    wrong_options:
      - `i` and `j` must both be 0.
      - `i` must be less than `j`.
      - `nums` must contain only positive numbers.
    explanation: |
      `i` and `j` must be valid indices between `0` and `nums.size() - 1` inclusive: Correct. The method checks bounds to prevent errors.
      `i` and `j` must both be 0: Incorrect. They can be any valid indices.
      `i` must be less than `j`: Incorrect. No ordering between `i` and `j` is required.
      `nums` must contain only positive numbers: Incorrect. Values don't matter for swapping — only valid indices.

  - question: |
      Analyze the `swapFirstLast` method:

      ```java

      {
          double temp = values.get(0);
          values.set(0, values.get(values.size() - 1));
          values.set(values.size() - 1, temp);
      }
      ```

      What could cause an error when calling `swapFirstLast`?

    correct_options:
      - Calling the method with an empty list.
    wrong_options:
      - Calling the method with only positive numbers.
      - Calling the method when the list has an even number of elements.
      - Calling the method with duplicate elements.
    explanation: |
      Calling the method with an empty list: Correct. `get(0)` and `get(values.size() - 1)` would throw exceptions if the list is empty.

              list.set(i, list.get(j));
              list.set(j, temp);
          }

      ```

      What precondition must be true before calling `swapNonAdjacent`?

    correct_options:
      - `x` and `y` must be valid list indices.
    wrong_options:
      - `x` must be exactly 1 greater than `y`.

  - question: |
      In the `getList` method below, what code should replace /* fill in here */ to correctly generate an array of random integers from 1 to 100 inclusive?

      ```java
      public int[] getList()
      {
          int[] list = new int[10];
          for (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++)
          {
              list[i] = /* fill in here */;
          }
          return list;
      }
      ```

    correct_options:
      - (int) (Math.random() * 100) + 1
    wrong_options:
      - (int) (Math.random() * 101)
      - (int) (Math.random() * 99) + 1
      - Math.random() * 100
    explanation: |
      (int) (Math.random() * 100) + 1: Correct. Multiplies by 100 (range [0, 100)), adds 1 → gives [1,100] inclusive.
      (int) (Math.random() * 101): Incorrect. This gives [0,100] inclusive, including 0 which is outside the requested range.
      (int) (Math.random() * 99) + 1: Incorrect. Only gets up to 99, missing 100.
      Math.random() * 100: Incorrect. This would produce a double, not an int.

  - question: |
      Suppose you want `getList` to generate random numbers from 0 to 50 inclusive.  
      Which code correctly fills in /* code to add integer to list */?

      ```java
      public int[] getList()
      {
          int[] list = new int[10];
          for (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++)
          {
              list[i] = /* fill in here */;
          }
          return list;
      }
      ```
    correct_options:
      - list[i] = (int) (Math.random() * 51);
    wrong_options:
      - list[i] = (int) (Math.random() * 50);
      - list[i] = (int) (Math.random() * 52);
      - list[i] = (Math.random() * 51);
    explanation: |
      list[i] = (int) (Math.random() * 51): Correct. Multiplies by 51 → values 0–50 inclusive after casting.
      list[i] = (int) (Math.random() * 50): Incorrect. Only generates up to 49.
      list[i] = (int) (Math.random() * 52): Incorrect. Could generate values up to 51, which is too large.
      list[i] = (Math.random() * 51): Incorrect. This would assign a `double`, causing a compile-time error.

  - question: |
      Consider this alternate `getList` implementation.

      ```java
      public int[] getList()
      {
          int[] list = new int[5];
          for (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++)
          {
              list[i] = (int) (Math.random() * 200) - 50;
          }
          return list;
      }
      ```

      What is the range of possible values stored in `list`?

    correct_options:
      - From -50 to 149
    wrong_options:
      - From -50 to 150
      - From 0 to 200
      - From 0 to 149
    explanation: |
      From -50 to 149: Correct. (Math.random() * 200) gives [0, 200), subtracting 50 shifts to [-50, 149].
      From -50 to 150: Incorrect. 150 is not included since Math.random() never reaches 1 exactly.
      From 0 to 200: Incorrect. The subtraction moves the range downward, starting at -50.
      From 0 to 149: Incorrect. The subtraction would make the minimum negative.

  - question: |
      Suppose in `getList`, you mistakenly use:

      ```java
      list[i] = Math.random() * 100;
      ```

      What kind of compile-time error would occur?

    correct_options:
      - Incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int
    wrong_options:
      - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
      - NullPointerException
      - ClassCastException
    explanation:
      Incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int: Correct. `Math.random()` returns `double`, so assigning without a cast to `int` causes a compile error.
      ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Incorrect. This happens at runtime if invalid indices are used, not here.
      NullPointerException: Incorrect. Not relevant; no object references are null here.
      ClassCastException: Incorrect. No illegal object casting is happening.
  - question: |
      Consider the following alternative `partialProd` method:

      ```java
      public static int[] partialProd(int[] arr) {
          int[] prod = new int[arr.length];
          prod[0] = arr[0];
          for (int j = 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
              prod[j] = prod[j-1] * arr[j];
          }
          return prod;
      }
      ```

      What is true about this implementation?

    correct_options:
      - It works correctly and is more efficient than using a nested loop.
    wrong_options:
      - It does not work because prod[0] is never initialized.
      - It does not work because it overwrites arr.
      - It incorrectly multiplies arr[j-1] * arr[j].
    explanations: |
      It works correctly and is more efficient than using a nested loop: Correct. It uses cumulative multiplication and avoids O(n²) time.
      It does not work because prod[0] is never initialized: Incorrect. prod[0] is initialized explicitly.
      It does not work because it overwrites arr: Incorrect. It only writes into prod, not arr.
      It incorrectly multiplies arr[j-1] * arr[j]: Incorrect. It multiplies the running product (prod[j-1]) with arr[j], which is correct.

  - question: |
      Why is Implementation 2 less efficient than Implementation 1 in the original `partialProd` question?

    correct_options:
      - It uses a nested loop causing O(n²) time complexity.
    wrong_options:
      - It modifies the original arr array.
      - It only calculates the product once.
      - It uses incorrect multiplication logic.
    explanations: |
      It uses a nested loop causing O(n²) time complexity: Correct. For each j, it loops through 0 to j.
      It modifies the original arr array: Incorrect. Only prod is modified.
      It only calculates the product once: Incorrect. It recalculates the product repeatedly.
      It uses incorrect multiplication logic: Incorrect. The logic is correct but inefficient.

  - question: |
      Suppose in the original partialProd code, the initialization loop

      ```java
      for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
          prod[j] = 1;
      }
      ```

      is **removed**. What issue could arise?

    correct_options:
      - Implementation 2 would not work correctly.
    wrong_options:
      - Implementation 1 would not work correctly.
      - Both implementations would still work correctly.
      - Implementation 2 would become faster.
    explanations: |
      Implementation 2 would not work correctly: Correct. Implementation 2 relies on prod[j] starting at 1 before multiplying.
      Implementation 1 would not work correctly: Incorrect. Implementation 1 assigns directly without relying on initial values.
      Both implementations would still work correctly: Incorrect. Implementation 2 would fail without initialization.
      Implementation 2 would become faster: Incorrect. It would not become faster; it would just be wrong.

  - question: |
      Suppose instead of initializing all elements of `prod` to 1, we initialize them to 0.  
      What would happen to the behavior of Implementation 2?

    correct_options:
      - All elements of prod would end up being 0.
    wrong_options:
      - prod would contain correct partial products.
      - prod would contain only the last value correct.
      - prod would not compile.
    explanations: |
      All elements of prod would end up being 0: Correct. Multiplying anything by 0 results in 0.
      prod would contain correct partial products: Incorrect. The initial 0 would corrupt the products.
      prod would contain only the last value correct: Incorrect. No intermediate value would be correct.
      prod would not compile: Incorrect. Syntax-wise, the code is fine; the error is logical.

  - question: |
      In the original question, if arr = {1, 2, 3}, what will prod look like after applying Implementation 1 (with no initialization loop)?

    correct_options:
      - {1, 2, 6}
    wrong_options:
      - {1, 3, 6}
      - {1, 4, 12}
      - {1, 2, 9}
    explanations: |
      {1, 2, 6}: Correct. 1, 1×2=2, 2×3=6.
      {1, 3, 6}: Incorrect. No step results in 3 at index 1.
      {1, 4, 12}: Incorrect. Incorrect cumulative multiplication.
      {1, 2, 9}: Incorrect. 2×3 is 6, not 9.
