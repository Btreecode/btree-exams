When writing a program, what is true about program documentation?  
I. Program documentation is useful while writing the program.  
II. Program documentation is useful after the program is written.  
III. Program documentation is not useful when run speed is a factor.

0. Nothing will be displayed due to an error.  
0. 3  
1. 6  
0. 11  

What will the following code segment display?
```
list1 ← [11, 3, 5, 6]
DISPLAY list1[4]
```

0. 35  
1. 43  
0. 68  
0. 73  

What is displayed after running the following algorithm?
```
list1 ← [1, 1, 35, 6]
total ← 0
FOR EACH item IN list1
 total ← total + item
DISPLAY total
```

1. Roundoff error  
0. Overflow error  
0. Logical error  
0. 2/3 will always equal 2/3  

What error has occurred if the phrase “Error” is displayed?

```plaintext
x ← 2/3  
y ← 2/3  
IF x = y  
    DISPLAY "Correct"  
ELSE  
    DISPLAY "Error"
```

1. newEntry(name, idNo, salary)  
0. newEntry(n, i, s)  
0. newEntry(id, n, s, n)  
0. newEntry(name, idNO)  

A programmer is planning to make a program that allows a company to organize its employees by name, ID number, and salary. Suppose the programmer is making a procedure called `newEntry` that takes in this data to create a new entry.  

Which of the following would be a good header for the procedure?

1. It's easier to find errors because any error-causing code is usually in the last change.  
0. It is faster because it requires less testing.  
0. It always produces the desired output regardless of the point in the development cycle.  
0. It requires less processor time at all stages of development.  

Why is it best to use an iterative and incremental process of program development?

0. It enables programmers to increase the level of complexity of the program and just focus on the current program.  
0. It ensures programmers can modify the language’s functions.  
1. It enables features to be used in multiple programs, which reduces the complexity of the code by allowing for reuse.  
0. It is a useful reminder to copy the entire source file at a later time.  

Most coding languages enable programmers to include a source file in the form of abstractions. For example, in C++, the command `#include <iostream>` grants the program access to basic input/output commands. Why would such a feature be useful in a language?

"Boids" is a flocking algorithm that is used to determine the direction of objects in a moving population. It is built on three principles:

I. Separation: steer to keep local flock mates at a certain distance  
II. Alignment: steer toward the average heading  
III. Cohesion: steer toward the center of the flock  

Suppose that a programmer is creating a method called `findBoidHeading` that calculates the heading of an individual boid in the flock. `findBoidHeading` takes in a data structure of the other boids in the program.  

The following commands are used on Boid objects. Assume that the name is representative of the function. Which might be useful in `findBoidHeading`?

0. Abstractions make it harder to edit because every extraction is saved on a distinct file.  
1. Abstractions simplify editing by requiring only one edit to the abstraction rather than to every instance of the code.  
1. Using abstractions takes up less space than repeating code, which makes the program easier to read.  
0. Abstractions are guaranteed to work in every instance, and if they work once, they are used.  

Why is it more effective to use abstractions in a program than to repeat code?
