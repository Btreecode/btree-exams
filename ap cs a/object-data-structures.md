A programmer plans to write a program that simulates a small bingo game (no more than six players). Each player will have a bingo card with 20 numbers from 0 to 90 (no duplicates). Someone will call out numbers one at a time, and each player will cross out a number in their card as it is called. The first player with all the numbers crossed out is the winner. In the simulation, the game is in progress, each playerâ€™s card is displayed on the screen.

The programmer envisions a short driver class whose main method has just two statements:
```java
BingoGame b = new BingoGame();
b.playBingo();
```
The BingoGame class will have several objects: a PlayerGroup, a Caller, and a PlayerGroup. The PlayerGroup will have a list of Players, and each Player will have a BingoCard.

Which is a reasonable data structure for a `BingoCard` object? Recall that there are 20 integers from 0 to 90 on a `BingoCard`, with no duplicates. There should also be mechanisms for crossing off numbers that are called and for detecting a winning card (i.e., one where all the numbers have been crossed off).

**I.**  
```java
int[] bingoCard;  // Will contain 20 integers  
// A number is crossed off by setting it to -1  
int numCrossedOff;  // Player wins when numCrossedOff reaches 20
```
**II.**
```java
boolean[] bingoCard; // Will contain 91 boolean values , of which 20 are true. All the other values are false.
// Thus, if bingoCard[k] is true, then k is on the card (0 <= k <= 90)  
// A number  k is crossed off by changing the value of bingoCard[k] to false  
int numCrossedOff;  // Player wins when numCrossedOff reaches 20.
```
**III.**
```java
ArrayList<Integer> bingoCard;  
// Will contain 20 integers  
// A number is crossed off by removing it from the ArrayList  
// Player wins when bingoCard.size() == 0
```
