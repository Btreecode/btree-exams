      ```java
      int x = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
      System.out.println(x);
      ```

    # You can decide the minimum and the maximum number of "correct options" to display.
    # First, the system will decide how many CORRECT options will be displayed
    # Second, the system will randomly choose the CORRECT options
    # Third, random incorrect options will be chosen to fill the total number. 
    # Make sure enough correct/incorrect options are available!
