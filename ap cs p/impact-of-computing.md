0. When collaborationg, too many people try to lead the group and not enough members are willing to take a backseat, which will delay the release of the program.
0. Conflicts in the working styles within the group will decrease staff morale.
0. With multiple people looking over code, errors can be quickly fixed.
1. Multiple people with different life experiences can see the code and give perspective on the ways the original programmer can decrease bias.

A programmer is writing software for a diverse set of users. While the program runs, the programmer wants to meet the needs of all her customers and reduce potential bias in her algorithms. What would be the benefit of collaborating with colleagues?

A certain computer has two identical processors that can run in parallel. Each processor can run only one process at a time, and each process must be executed on a single processor. In this problem, processes four and five must be run sequentially while processes one, two, and three can all run in parallel. The following table indicates the amount of time each process takes to execute on a single processor.

| Process | Execution Time (seconds) |
|---------|--------------------------|
| One     | 3                        |
| Two     | 2                        |
| Three   | 5                        |
| Four    | 4                        |
| Five    | 4                        |

Which of the following best approximates the minimum possible time to run the five processes?

1. Simulations are more expensive to use and harder to make changes to  
0. The parameters of a simulation can be altered easily to test varying circumstances  
0. Simulations can run faster than real-time experiments and thus save time
