An image is stored on a computer contains pixels that represent how bright the red, green, and blue values are. The most common format for pixels is to represent the red, green, and blue, using 8 bits, which vary from 0 to 255. If the current red value is 10011101, what woud be the new value in binary if the red value is increased by 4 in decimal?

Errors in Microsoft Windows are often displayed with binary error codes. If this number is converted into a decimal, it can be used by certain utilities to diagnose the problem with the computer.  
If a stop error (i.e., a “Blue Screen of Death”) returns the error code 10001111, what is the error? (Ignore the “0x” at the start; this is a signal that the number is in hexadecimal.)
