  - Every user's full name and social security number are included in the dataset.
  - The data has been encrypted so that even the marketing firm cannot read it.
  - The data is deleted from the original company's servers immediately after it is sold.
  explanation: |
    - Aggregation focuses on the "big picture" (e.g., "70% of users bought shoes") rather than specific individual actions.
- question: |
    Select TWO answers.
    Which of the following are effective strategies for individuals to protect themselves against **phishing** attacks?
  correct_options:
  - Carefully inspecting the sender's email address and looking for subtle misspellings in links before clicking.
  - Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all sensitive accounts like banking and email.
  wrong_options:
  - Responding to the suspicious email to ask the sender if they are a legitimate representative.
  - Disabling the "spam" filter on your email account so you can manually review every incoming message.
  explanation: |
    - Vigilance and MFA are the strongest defenses. Responding to phishers only confirms your email is active, and disabling filters increases risk.
