      A small team of butterfly researchers are working on a project that monitors
      the success rate of the caterpillars to butterfly transition. Which of the
      following best explains why citizen science is considered useful for this
      project?  

      *Select two answers.*
    correct_options:
      - Distributed individuals are more likely able to count a larger number of
        caterpillars and butterflies over a larger area than a small team of
        researchers.
      - The reach of social media can be used to allow interested individuals from
        different locations to contribute to this project.
    wrong_options:
      - The general public are more likely to accurately identify the type of
        caterpillar.
      - Counting caterpillars and butterflies is inherently too complex for citizen
        scientists.
