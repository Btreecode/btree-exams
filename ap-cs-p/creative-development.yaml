      A programmer is planning to make a program that allows a company to organize
      its employees by name, ID number, and salary. Suppose the programmer is making
      a procedure called `newEntry` that takes in this data to create a new entry.  


      Which of the following would be a good header for the procedure?
    correct_options:
      - newEntry(name, idNo, salary)
    wrong_options:
      - newEntry(n, i, s)
      - newEntry(id, n, s, n)
      - newEntry(name, idNO)
  - question: >-
      Why is it best to use an iterative and incremental process of program
      development?
    correct_options:
      - It's easier to find errors because any error-causing code is usually in the
        last change.
    wrong_options:
      - It is faster because it requires less testing.
      - It always produces the desired output regardless of the point in the
        development cycle.
      - It requires less processor time at all stages of development.
  - question: >-
      Most coding languages enable programmers to include a source file in
      the form of abstractions. For example, in C++, the command `#include
      <iostream>` grants the program access to basic input/output commands. Why
      would such a feature be useful in a language?
    correct_options:
      - It enables features to be used in multiple programs, which reduces the
        complexity of the code by allowing for reuse.
    wrong_options:
      - It is a useful reminder to copy the entire source file at a later time.
      - It ensures programmers can modify the language’s functions.
      - It enables programmers to increase the level of complexity of the program
        and just focus on the current program.
  - question: >-
      "Boids" is a flocking algorithm that is used to determine the direction of
      objects in a moving population. It is built on three principles:


      I. Separation: steer to keep local flock mates at a certain distance  

      II. Alignment: steer toward the average heading  

      III. Cohesion: steer toward the center of the flock  


      Suppose that a programmer is creating a method called `findBoidHeading` that
      calculates the heading of an individual boid in the flock. `findBoidHeading`
      takes in a data structure of the other boids in the program.  


      The following commands are used on Boid objects. Assume that the name is
      representative of the function. Which might be useful in `findBoidHeading`?  


      **Select two answers.**
    correct_options:
      - getVelocity
      - getHeading
    wrong_options:
      - getDate
      - getShape
  - question: >-
      Why is it more effective to use abstractions in a program than to repeat
      code?  


      **Select two answers.**
    correct_options:
      - Abstractions simplify editing by requiring only one edit to the abstraction
        rather than to every instance of the code.
      - Using abstractions takes up less space than repeating code, which makes the
        program easier to read.
    wrong_options:
      - Abstractions make it harder to edit because every extraction is saved on a
        distinct file.
      - Abstractions are guaranteed to work in every instance, and if they work
        once, they are used.

      A video game played using a home system has released the second game in the
      series, which uses a mobile phone to play the game. This upgraded game
      interacts with real-life locations, resulting in a virtual reality experience.
      The user interacts with the game based on his or her location and the time of
      day. The game will not work if the user is traveling faster than 3 miles per
      hour to prevent people from playing while driving. By making events at
      locations of interest, the video game will expose the user to public artwork,
      historical sites, and local businesses.

      Which of the following input data is needed by the upgraded game that was NOT
      needed by the original game?
    correct_options:
      - GPS location
    wrong_options:
      - Event sensing; an event would be the user pushing a button or screen
      - Age of the player
      - Picture of the player
