questions:
- question: |
    A programmer is testing a new algorithm but finds it produces the wrong output for negative numbers. Which of the following is the most effective debugging strategy?
  correct_options:
  - Use print statements to display the value of variables at different stages of the algorithm.
  wrong_options:
  - Delete the entire code and rewrite it from memory.
  - Only test the program with positive numbers to ensure it works correctly for those.
  - Rename all the variables to make the code look more professional.
  explanation: |
    - "Trace" or "Print" debugging allows a programmer to see where logic fails by checking intermediate values during execution.

- question: |
    Which of the following is a benefit of using a collaborative version control system, such as Git, for a group project?
  correct_options:
  - It allows multiple people to work on the same code simultaneously and merge their changes later.
  wrong_options:
  - It automatically identifies and fixes all syntax errors in the code.
  - It prevents anyone from seeing the code history to maintain security.
  - It translates the code into multiple programming languages automatically.
  explanation: |
    - Version control systems are designed for collaboration, allowing for branching, merging, and tracking the history of changes made by different team members.
- question: |
    A programmer is working on a complex procedure and notices it does not produce the expected output. Which of the following debugging strategies would be MOST effective for identifying the logic error?
  correct_options:
  - Inserting temporary "display" statements to check the values of variables at different points in the program.
  wrong_options:
  - Deleting the entire procedure and rewriting it from memory.
  - Removing all comments from the code to make it run faster.
  - Changing the variable names to be shorter and more cryptic.
  explanation: |
    - Tracing variable values during execution is a fundamental way to see exactly where the logic diverges from the intended behavior.

- question: |
    A student is collaborating with a classmate on a program. They decide to use "Pair Programming." Which of the following describes a typical benefit of this approach?
  correct_options:
  - It leads to fewer errors because one person writes the code while the other reviews it in real-time.
  wrong_options:
  - It allows the program to run twice as fast because two people are working on it.
  - It eliminates the need for any documentation or comments in the code.
  - It ensures that the program will be compatible with all operating systems.
  explanation: |
    - Pair programming involves a "driver" and a "navigator," which helps catch bugs early and improves the overall design of the code.

- question: |
    A programmer encounters a "Runtime Error" while their program is running. What does this usually mean?
  correct_options:
  - The program's instructions were valid, but an impossible operation occurred during execution (like dividing by zero).
  wrong_options:
  - The programmer forgot a semicolon or a closing parenthesis in the source code.
  - The computer's monitor is not compatible with the software.
  - The program was written in a language the computer does not understand.
  explanation: |
    - Runtime errors happen *while* the program is running, often due to unexpected data or logic that leads to an illegal operation.
- question: |
    A group of developers is using a **Version Control System** (such as Git) for their project. Which of the following is a primary advantage of this system?
  correct_options:
  - It allows multiple people to work on the same files simultaneously and provides a history of all changes made.
  wrong_options:
  - It automatically translates Python code into JavaScript for web compatibility.
  - It prevents any bugs from being introduced into the main branch of the code.
  - It eliminates the need for programmers to write comments or documentation.
  explanation: |
    - Version control manages "merging" changes from different people and allows teams to "roll back" to previous versions if a new update breaks the program.

- question: |
    In the context of software development, what is the purpose of a **README** file or documentation?
  correct_options:
  - To provide instructions on how to set up, use, and contribute to the project.
  wrong_options:
  - To store the binary data for the program's executable file.
  - To act as a firewall that prevents unauthorized access to the source code.
  - To replace the need for writing actual code by describing the program's intent.
  explanation: |
    - Documentation is essential for collaboration, ensuring that other developers (and the original creator) understand how the code is intended to function.

- question: |
    A student is designing an app to help classmates track homework deadlines. Which action best demonstrates the **iterative development process**?
  correct_options:
  - Releasing a simple version, collecting user feedback, and updating features based on that feedback.
  wrong_options:
  - Waiting until every possible feature is complete before testing with any users.
  - Avoiding user feedback to prevent changes to the original idea.
  - Rewriting the entire app from scratch after each minor bug fix.
  explanation: |
    - Iterative development emphasizes building, testing, and refining in repeated cycles.

- question: |
    Which of the following is the clearest example of identifying a program's **purpose** and **intended user**?
  correct_options:
  - "This app helps middle school students practice fraction problems with immediate feedback."
  wrong_options:
  - "This app uses loops, lists, and conditionals."
  - "This app has over 2,000 lines of code."
  - "This app was written in a modern programming language."
  explanation: |
    - Purpose statements should describe what problem the program solves and for whom.

- question: |
    A team is planning features for a game prototype with limited time. Which strategy best supports creative development?
  correct_options:
  - Prioritize a minimum viable feature set, then add enhancements in later iterations.
  wrong_options:
  - Build all optional features first and postpone core gameplay.
  - Avoid making design decisions until after final deployment.
  - Remove all playtesting to save development time.
  explanation: |
    - Focusing on core functionality first enables faster feedback and better design decisions.

- question: |
    During development, students discover users are confused by menu labels. What is the most appropriate next step?
  correct_options:
  - Revise the interface labels and retest with users to see whether usability improves.
  wrong_options:
  - Keep the labels unchanged so the code does not need modifications.
  - Add unrelated features instead of addressing the confusion.
  - Increase the app's font size without changing the label wording.
  explanation: |
    - User-centered iteration means using observed problems to guide targeted improvements.

- question: |
    Which practice best supports productive collaboration on a shared creative coding project?
  correct_options:
  - Dividing responsibilities, reviewing each other's work, and integrating changes regularly.
  wrong_options:
  - Having one person write all code while others wait until the end.
  - Avoiding communication so each person can work independently.
  - Editing the same file at the same time without coordination.
  explanation: |
    - Clear roles, frequent communication, and regular integration reduce conflicts and improve project quality.
