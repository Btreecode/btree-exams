With the lowering of the digital divide and more products using the internet, the world is running out of IP addresses. The current plan is to switch from IPv4, which holds 32 bits, to IPv6, which holds 128 bits.

With the increase from 32 bits to 128 bits, what is the resulting increase in possible IP addresses?

Which of the following trade-offs is true when representing information as digital data?

II. Reading data and updating data have different storage requirements.  
III. Lossy data compression reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted at the cost of being able to reconstruct only an approximation of the original.
