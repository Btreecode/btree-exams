      - 72,000,000 bits
      - 24,000,000 bytes
    explanation: |
      - **Correct:**  
        - 1000×1000 = 1,000,000 pixels  
        - 3 channels × 8 bits = 24 bits/pixel  
        - Total = 1,000,000 × 24 = 24,000,000 bits  
      - **Incorrect:** Common mistakes include calculating bytes instead of bits, or only including 1 color channel.

  - question: |
      A photographer shares a JPEG version of a photo instead of a RAW image file.

      What trade-offs are being made by using JPEG?

      Select **two** correct answers.

    wrong_options:
      - The JPEG file can store more metadata than a RAW file
      - The JPEG file loads slower because of higher resolution
      - JPEG is uncompressed and preserves all pixel values
      - JPEG formats cannot be opened by common programs
    explanation: |
      - **Correct:** JPEG uses lossy compression — smaller file, less detail.
      - **Incorrect:** RAW stores more metadata and detail; JPEG is compressed and widely used.

  - question: |
      A student checks the properties of two image files.

      - File A: 1920×1080, JPEG, 1.2MB  
      - File B: 1920×1080, PNG, 3.6MB

      Why is File B larger despite having the same resolution?
    correct_options:
      - PNG uses lossless compression, which retains all pixel data
    wrong_options:
      - PNG files are larger because they use binary instead of decimal
      - JPEG is not a real image format
      - PNG uses lower resolution than JPEG
      - File A is corrupted and missing data
      - JPEG stores images as text while PNG uses graphics
    explanation: |
      - **Correct:** PNG retains all original data — no loss — so the file is larger.
      - **Incorrect:** Both formats use binary; JPEG is valid; resolution is the same.

      - **Correct:** Biased inputs produce unfair or skewed algorithmic decisions.
      - **Incorrect:** Other answers are unrelated to dataset composition.

  - question: |
      A file stores image data along with additional attributes.  
      Which of the following are examples of **image metadata**?

      Select **three** correct answers.
    correct_options:
      - Image resolution
      - GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken
      - Date and time the photo was created
    wrong_options:
      - The color of the top-left pixel
      - The number of red pixels
      - The file’s current directory on the desktop
    explanation: |
      - **Correct:** Metadata gives context, not content. Resolution, time, and location describe the file.
      - **Incorrect:** Color values and file path are not embedded metadata in most formats.

  - question: |
      Which of the following best describes a **lossless compression** algorithm?

    correct_options:
      - It reduces file size while allowing for the exact original data to be restored
    wrong_options:
      - It permanently deletes unnecessary data to save space
      - It encrypts the file using a secret key
      - It converts binary data to text to compress it
      - It changes image resolution to lower quality
    explanation: |
      - **Correct:** Lossless keeps all data and allows perfect restoration.
      - **Incorrect:** Deletion and quality reduction apply to lossy methods; encryption and conversion are unrelated.
