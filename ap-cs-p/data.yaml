  - question:
      An image is stored on a computer contains pixels that represent how
      bright the red, green, and blue values are. The most common format for pixels
      is to represent the red, green, and blue, using 8 bits, which vary from 0 to
      255. If the current red value is 10011101, what woud be the new value in
      binary if the red value is increased by 4 in decimal?
    correct_options:
      - 10100001 bin
    wrong_options:
      - 10011111 bin
      - 0100 bin
      - 157 bin

      At one of the lowest levels of abstraction, digital data are represented in
      binary (a combination of digital zeros and ones).  

      The number `100101` in binary is equivalent to what number when converted to
      base 10 (DEC)?
    correct_options:
      - "23"
    wrong_options:
      - "37"
      - "45"
      - "86"

      Errors in Microsoft Windows are often displayed with binary error codes. If
      this number is converted into a decimal, it can be used by certain utilities
      to diagnose the problem with the computer.  

      If a stop error (i.e., a “Blue Screen of Death”) returns the error code
      10001111, what is the error? (Ignore the “0x” at the start; this is a signal
      that the number is in hexadecimal.)
