- question: |
    A photographer is uploading high-resolution images to a website but needs to reduce the file size significantly while accepting that some fine detail will be permanently lost. Which of the following is the most appropriate technique?
  correct_options:
  - Applying JPEG compression to the images.
  wrong_options:
  - Compressing the images into a ZIP archive.
  - Converting the images to a lossless PNG format.
  - Storing the images as raw BMP files.
  explanation: |
    - JPEG is a lossy compression format, meaning it reduces file size by permanently discarding some data, which is acceptable for web display where perfect detail isn't required.

    A music streaming service stores the artist's name, the album title, and the track duration alongside the actual audio recording. Which of the following is true about this information?
  correct_options:
  - It is metadata that helps in searching and organizing the music library.
  wrong_options:
  - It is the audio data that produces the sound when played.
  - It is the compression algorithm used to reduce the file size.
  - It is a form of encryption used to prevent illegal copying.
  explanation: |
    - Identifying information like artist and album title describes the content (the audio) and is therefore metadata.

    Which of the following are primary benefits of using **cloud computing** for a small business?
  correct_options:
  - It allows employees to access files and collaborative tools from any location with an Internet connection.
  - It enables the business to scale its computing resources (like storage and processing power) up or down based on current needs.
  wrong_options:
  - It guarantees that data will never be lost or corrupted, even if the cloud provider's servers fail.
  - It eliminates the need for any local networking hardware like routers or Wi-Fi access points.
  explanation: |
    - Cloud computing provides accessibility and scalability. While reliable, no system is "100% guaranteed" against all failure, and local hardware is still needed to connect to the Internet.

  - Which students feel that the library staff is helpful and knowledgeable?
  explanation: |
    - The dataset contains quantitative data (majors, dates, titles) that can show trends and counts, but it cannot measure subjective feelings (helpfulness) or preferences not recorded in the logs (e-readers).

- question: |
    Select TWO answers.
    A city's public works department tracks every maintenance request for "potholes," including the GPS coordinates, the date the report was filed, and the time it took to complete the repair. Which TWO of the following can be determined from this data?
  correct_options:
  - Which geographic regions of the city have the highest frequency of reported potholes?
  - What is the average "turnaround time" for a pothole repair from the initial report to completion?
  wrong_options:
  - What is the primary cause of pothole formation in the city center?
  - Are residents satisfied with the quality of the new asphalt being used?
  explanation: |
    - GPS and dates allow for location and time-efficiency analysis. Identifying the "cause" or "satisfaction" would require geological data or user surveys, which aren't in this specific dataset.
