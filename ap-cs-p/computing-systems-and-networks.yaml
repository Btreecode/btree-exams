      With the lowering of the digital divide and more products using the internet,
      the world is running out of IP addresses. The current plan is to switch from
      IPv4, which holds 32 bits, to IPv6, which holds 128 bits.


      With the increase from 32 bits to 128 bits, what is the resulting increase in
      possible IP addresses?

      Which of the following trade-offs is true when representing information as
      digital data?  

      I. An analog signal must be sampled and turned into numbers that are then
      stored digitally as bits.  

      II. Reading data and updating data have different storage requirements.  

      III. Lossy data compression reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted
      at the cost of being able to reconstruct only an approximation of the
      original.

      - I, II, and III
    wrong_options:
      - I and III only
