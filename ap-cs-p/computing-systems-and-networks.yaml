  - question: |
      When switching from IPv4 (32-bit) to IPv6 (128-bit), how many more unique addresses become available?
    correct_options:
      - 2^96
    wrong_options:
      - 96^2
      - 2 * 96
      - 128 / 32
    explanation: |
      - **Correct:** IPv6 has 128 bits vs IPv4’s 32 bits → 2^96 times more addresses.
      - **Incorrect:** Other options confuse bit arithmetic with basic math.

      Which protocol helps this device determine the path?

    correct_options:
      - IP (Internet Protocol)
    wrong_options:
      - TCP
      - DNS
      - HTML
      - FTP
      - CSS
    explanation: |
      - **Correct:** IP is responsible for addressing and routing packets.
      - **Incorrect:** TCP ensures delivery; DNS resolves domains; HTML/CSS/FTP are unrelated.
  - question: |
      Which of the following **secure transmission methods** help protect data sent over the internet?

      Select **two** correct answers.
    correct_options:
      - Using HTTPS instead of HTTP
      - Encrypting data before transmission

      - HTML
      - CSS
    explanation: |
      - **Correct:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures ordered, complete delivery.
      - **Incorrect:** IP routes; DNS maps names; FTP/HTML/CSS are for content and styling.

  - question: |
      Which of the following statements about **routing on the internet** are true?

      Select **two** correct answers.
    correct_options:
      - Routers choose paths based on current traffic and availability
      - Data can take different paths to the same destination
    wrong_options:
      - Routers always use the shortest path
      - Data packets must travel through only one ISP
      - All packets in a message follow the same route
      - Packets must go through a central server
    explanation: |
      - **Correct:** Routing is dynamic; redundancy allows different paths.
      - **Incorrect:** Packets don’t always follow the same path, and routing adapts in real time.

  - question: |
      DNS (Domain Name System) plays which role in the internet’s communication model?

    correct_options:
      - Translates human-readable domains to IP addresses
    wrong_options:
      - Encrypts messages before transmission
      - Checks for packet delivery errors
      - Tracks user activity
